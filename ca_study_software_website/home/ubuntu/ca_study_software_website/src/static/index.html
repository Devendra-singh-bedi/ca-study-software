        <section>
            <h2>Data Ingestion Layer</h2>
            <p>The Data Ingestion Layer is critical for bringing the vast amount of ICAI study materials into the system. Given that most ICAI materials are in PDF format, this layer will need robust capabilities to extract text, images, and potentially structural information from these documents. The process will involve several steps:</p>
            <h3>3.1. Data Sources</h3>
            <p>The primary data source will be the official ICAI website (icai.org and boslive.icai.org), where study materials for Foundation, Intermediate, and Final courses are published. These materials include textbooks, practice manuals, and other supplementary resources. The system will need to periodically check for updates and new releases from these sources to ensure the study content remains current.</p>
            <h3>3.2. PDF Parsing and Extraction</h3>
            <p>PDF documents are complex and can contain various elements such as text, images, tables, and different formatting. The ingestion process will require advanced PDF parsing techniques to accurately extract all relevant content. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) may be necessary for image-based PDFs or scanned documents to convert them into searchable text. The extracted text will need to preserve the original document structure, including headings, subheadings, paragraphs, and lists, to maintain context and facilitate accurate information retrieval.</p>
            <h3>3.3. Data Validation and Cleaning</h3>
            <p>After extraction, the data will undergo validation and cleaning to ensure its quality and consistency. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Text Cleaning:</strong> Removing irrelevant characters, headers, footers, and page numbers that are not part of the core content.</li>
                <li><strong>Structure Preservation:</strong> Ensuring that the hierarchical structure of the document (e.g., chapters, sections, topics) is correctly identified and maintained.</li>
                <li><strong>Metadata Extraction:</strong> Extracting relevant metadata such as subject, paper, module, chapter, and publication date, which will be crucial for organizing and searching the content.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Implementing mechanisms to identify and handle corrupted or malformed PDF files, or extraction errors.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.4. Ingestion Pipeline</h3>
