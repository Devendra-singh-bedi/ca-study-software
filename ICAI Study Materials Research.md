## Summary of Research Findings:

ICAI provides comprehensive study materials for all three levels of the CA examination: Foundation, Intermediate, and Final. These materials are organized by paper and often further divided into modules and chapters. The content is primarily in PDF format and covers a wide range of subjects including Accounting, Business Laws, Quantitative Aptitude, Business Economics, Advanced Accounting, Corporate and Other Laws, Taxation, Cost and Management Accounting, Auditing and Ethics, Financial Reporting, Advanced Financial Management, and Advanced Auditing, Assurance and Professional Ethics.

Each paper typically includes:
- Initial Pages (often containing syllabus, preface, and table of contents)
- Chapters with detailed explanations of concepts
- Units within chapters for specific topics
- Practice Questions (in some modules)
- Hindi Medium versions for some papers.

The materials are extensive and cover theoretical concepts, practical applications, and relevant laws and standards. The sheer volume of content suggests that an AI-powered study software would be highly beneficial for students to navigate, understand, and retain the information effectively.

## Next Steps:
- Design the system architecture based on the understanding of the ICAI materials and the requirements for an AI-powered study software.
- Plan the AI implementation strategy, focusing on features like doubt solving, mock tests, and progress tracking.
- Develop detailed specifications for core features.
- Create a technical roadmap and implementation plan.
- Compile comprehensive documentation and deliver the results.
